## Getting Started

New to the project? Here's what to read first:

1. Start with the [**Architecture Guide**](./architecture.md) for a high-level overview
2. Read the [**Native Code Guide**](./native-code-guide.md) to understand the native implementation
3. For adding new native features, follow the [**Native Module Guide**](./native-module-guide.md)

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes to the codebase, please update the relevant documentation files. If creating new subsystems or patterns, consider adding a new dedicated guide.

Documentation should:
- Be clear and concise
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Explain both "how" and "why"
- Be updated when the code changes

## Building the Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and can be viewed directly on GitHub or using any Markdown viewer.
